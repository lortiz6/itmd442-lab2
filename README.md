## Project Description:
This project focuses on practicing CRUD operations (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) within a Node.js Express application. The main objective is to build a contact database where users can perform various actions like creating, editing, viewing, and deleting contacts. Instead of utilizing a traditional database, the application stores data persistently using a file on the file system, similar to class demonstrations.

## Development Environment:
- **Device:** Dell 360 2 in 1
- **Node.js Version:** v20.10.0
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code

## Installation/Running Instructions:
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Issue the command `npm start` to start the application
5. Visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser

## Insights and Results:
During the development process, I gained experience in HTML using the Pug format, along with some rendering features. However, I encountered an issue where the pages were not loading, and I received the error message: "This site canâ€™t be reached - localhost refused to connect. ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED." After troubleshooting, I realized that I had forgotten to run the `npm start` command to start my application, which resolved the issue.
